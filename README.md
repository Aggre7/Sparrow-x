# Distributed-X

Pretty much the about section: A practically Distributed Social Media System having most large scale production features but distilled down to a minimalist blueprint that is easy for mentors to mentor with.

## Goals Of This Project
- ðŸ”¹ Using Vertical Slice Architecture for architecture level.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Spring MVC as a Web Framework.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Domain Driven Design (DDD) to implement all business processes in microservices.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Spring AMQP on top of Rabbitmq for Event Driven Architecture between our microservices.
- ðŸ”¹ Using gRPC for internal communication between our microservices.
- ðŸ”¹ Using CQRS implementation with a Mediator library.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Spring Data JPA for data persistence and ORM in write side with Postgres.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Spring Data Cassandra for data persistence and ORM in read side with CassandraDB.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Spring Data Neo4j for graph-based queries, social graph traversal, and recommendation logic.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Inbox Pattern for ensuring message idempotency for receiver and Exactly once Delivery.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Outbox Pattern for ensuring no message is lost and there is at At Least One Delivery.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Unit Testing for testing small units and mocking our dependencies with Mockito.
- ðŸ”¹ Using End-To-End Testing and Integration Testing for testing features with all dependencies using testcontainers.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Spring Validator and a Validation Pipeline Behavior on top of Mediator.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Springdoc Openapi for generating OpenAPI documentation in Spring Boot.
- ðŸ”¹ Using OpenTelemetry Collector for collecting Metrics, Tracings, and Structured Logs.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Kibana for Logging top of OpenTelemetry Collector.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Jaeger for Distributed Tracing top of OpenTelemetry Collector.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring top of OpenTelemetry Collector.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Keycloak for authentication and authorization based on OpenID-Connect and OAuth2.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Spring Cloud Gateway MVC as a Microservices' gateway.



## Roadmap
