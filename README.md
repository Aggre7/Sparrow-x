# Sparrow-X

A distributed systems playground where the main feature is GraphRAG, using graph-structured data from a realistic social network to power LLM queries, insights, and experiments. While the twitter clone is just the substrate inspired by Grok, whose access to over a quarter-billion active user interactions transforms X into a second-generation, directory-like network of human knowledge, Sparrowx distills that idea into an accessible MVP: a place where juniors and product/engineering managers alike can explore how graph-aware AI unlocks new ways of navigating and reasoning over connected data, instrument, measure and act on the intelligence hidden inside AI-driven workflows through observability tools.

## Goals Of This Project
- ðŸ”¹ Using Vertical Slice Architecture for architecture level.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Spring MVC as a Web Framework.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Domain Driven Design (DDD) to implement all business processes in microservices.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Spring AMQP on top of Rabbitmq for Event Driven Architecture between our microservices.
- ðŸ”¹ Using gRPC for internal communication between our microservices.
- ðŸ”¹ Using CQRS implementation with a Mediator library.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Spring AI for GraphRAG, enabling hybrid retrieval (graph traversals + vector search) and natural language queries over the social graph --> Supporting multi-hop GraphRAG queries, where the system can traverse multiple edges (e.g., User â†’ Follows â†’ User â†’ Tweets â†’ Hashtags) to generate richer, context-aware answers and recommendations.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Spring Data JPA for data persistence and ORM in write side with Postgres.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Spring Data Cassandra for data persistence and ORM in read side with CassandraDB.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Spring Data Neo4j for graph-based queries, social graph traversal, and recommendation logic.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Inbox Pattern for ensuring message idempotency for receiver and Exactly once Delivery.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Outbox Pattern for ensuring no message is lost and there is at At Least One Delivery.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Unit Testing for testing small units and mocking our dependencies with Mockito.
- ðŸ”¹ Using End-To-End Testing and Integration Testing for testing features with all dependencies using testcontainers.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Spring Validator and a Validation Pipeline Behavior on top of Mediator.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Springdoc Openapi for generating OpenAPI documentation in Spring Boot.
- ðŸ”¹ Using OpenTelemetry Collector for collecting Metrics, Tracings, and Structured Logs.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Loki for Logging.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Tempo for Distributed Tracing.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Keycloak for authentication and authorization based on OpenID-Connect and OAuth2.
- ðŸ”¹ Using Spring Cloud Gateway MVC as a Microservices' gateway.
